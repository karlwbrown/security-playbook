### To install eslint and plugins used in [this eslint config file](https://github.com/saradiaz/security-baseline/blob/master/JavaScript/source-code-analysis/.eslintrc.json):

note: -D is --save-dev

`$ npm install -D eslint`  
`$ npm install -D eslint-plugin-security`  
`$ npm install -D eslint-plugin-scanjs-rules`  
`$ npm install -D eslint-plugin-no-unsafe-innerhtml`  

### Once you've done this, you can either
* use the .eslintrc.json as-is from this repo
* run `$ eslint --init`* with your project-specific details and include the plugins and rules from our config file*  

	*if you are using the eslint specific to your project, you might have to run `$ ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --init`
	
	*this will result in many non-security related linting rules which you can disable by commenting out `"extends": "blah",` in the .eslintrc file generated by your init.
	

### One more thing...
You might want to create a file called .eslintignore (or something) containing the line  
`node_modules/`.  
You can then specify the option --ignore-path .eslintignore when you run eslint. This will save you a lot of false positives. 

### You're ready to go!
For a quick start, try:  
`$ eslint .`

To create an HTML output file you can view in your browser, try:  
`$ eslint --ignore-path .eslintignore -f html -o eslint-report.html .`
