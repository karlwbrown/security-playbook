# Static Analysis

## What is it?
* Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis).

## Why is it needed?
* Static analysis can detect common programming "smells"
* There are specific tools that can look for known security vulnerabilities using static analysis

## Tasks
More than one tool may be needed based on the languages, frameworks, and tooling used in the project.

* [Choose a static analysis tool for Ruby/Ruby on Rails](ruby-rails.md)
* TODO: Choose a static analysis tool for Javascript
* TODO: Choose a static analysis tool for Java
