# Static Application Security Tools

## What is it?
* A static analysis tool, referred to as a Static Application Security Tool
  (SAST) in the context of security, identifies potential security flaws in
  source code, byte code, and binaries. SAST tools provide a powerful way to
  identify potential defects by analyzing applications from the "inside out".
  This provides much greater sight into possible flaws than a scanner that only
  interacts with a application as a user would.

## Why is it needed?
* Sometimes the easiest or most obvious way to do something is also not secure.
  These tools provide fast feedback if a mistake is made.
* Continuous, fast feedback about potential vulnerabilities saves teams time and
  stress.

## When should I use this?
* In your CI pipeline. Automatically run the scanner periodically, possibly
  alongside other automated tests following a checkin if it can complete quickly
  enough.
* During manual testing. More in-depth scans can be run and verified along with
  the other necessary manual tests. Testers can also start to do some
  exploratory security testing after familiarizing themselves with typical
  weaknesses.

## Tasks
Below are tasks organized by technical stack to introduce static analysis tools.

* Python: [Bandit](bandit.md)
* JavaScript: [eslint](eslint.md)
* Ruby (Rails & Other Frameworks): [Brakeman](brakeman.md) [Dawnscanner](dawnscanner.md)

## Additional Information

* TODO: Add sample config file for bandit; more details on CI pipeline integration
