# Project Security Playbook for Teams

The purpose of this resource is to begin gathering a collection of tasks and
best practices that project development teams should do to help stay ahead of
common security risks. By considering these, teams can help raise visibility of
some risks and avoid others.

This is an early stage resource that will be added to regularly.

## Project Goals

* Commoditize knowledge about how development teams can manage security risks
  throughout the development lifecycle in a way that is relatable and accessible
  to them.
* Create actionable tasks to implement security controls that teams can put in
  their backlogs along with the information needed to help justify the effort.
* Automate creation and testing of security controls whenever possible.

## Iteration 1

These are concerns that should be considered right from the outset of a new
project.

* [Secret Management](tooling/secret-management/README.md)
* [Dependency Checkers for the Automated Pipeline](tooling/dependency-checker/README.md)
* TODO: Software Update Notifications for Infrastructure
* [Web App Bootstrapping](webapps/README.md)
* TODO: Harden Development/Test/Build Systems Using Automated Tools
* TODO: Static Analysis Tools
